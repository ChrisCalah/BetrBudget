# Tests

# Adopted Technologies
Adopted the basic Android Studio project to build the app. Used Java to script interactions between web pages and the pie chart expense report. The pie chart used (MPAndroidChart), an open free use charting program was implemented via gradle and belongs to Phillip Jahoda (https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart). To make the chart, the team had to research and adopt the various function calls and classes from the MPAndroidChart program, We chose MPAndroidChart because it was free to use, simple, and elagant. XML was used to layout the individual screens.

# Learning/Training
Members of the team used official documentation for insights into specific functions of use. Members additionally followed YouTube tutorials to get an understanding of the Android Studio application and its abilities.

# Look & Feel

For this release we decided to focus on creating a functional and easy to understand user interface. We opted to have a pie chart on the home page to represent your spending this month and what percentage of your budget was spent on what catagory.

To navigate through the app we decided to have a hotbar at the bottom of the screen with a static set of icons for each secion available to the user. We will be eventually developing our own images for these buttons to make the sections clearer to the user and give a better look to the application.
