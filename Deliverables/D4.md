# Implemented Requirements

# Tests

# Adopted Technologies
Adopted the basic Android Studio project to build the app. Used Java to script interactions between web pages and the pie chart expense report. The pie chart used (MPAndroidChart), an open free use charting program was implemented via gradle and belongs to Phillip Jahoda (https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart). To make the chart, the team had to research and adopt the various function calls and classes from the MPAndroidChart program, We chose MPAndroidChart because it was free to use, simple, and elagant. XML was used to layout the individual screens.
