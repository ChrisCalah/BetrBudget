As college students start growing out of dependencies on their parents, one of the most important lessons to be taught is financial responsibility. There are many ways to keep track of a budget but it can be confusing to the point of deferring the user. With BetrBudget, a simple and valuable budgeting app, the user is opened up to the world of finances in the form of a simplistic design, without the intimidating features that most students wouldn't understand how to use anyways. Unlike other apps, curating to college students and younger audiences is something that is taken seriously. Not only is there a simpler easier to understand design, but also features that specifically curate towards people with lower incomes that typically live in roommate environments. By using BetrBudget, keeping financially organized without putting in lots of research and time into learning how to budget is possible and being newly independent is a lot easier.

Our app also will allow us to create groups where multiple registered users can track shared expenses together. This will mostly be intended for shared periodic expenses between the members of the group, such as rent or a shared subscription service. Each group member will have their own permissions level (admin, edit, view) which can be set by the group owner (or those with 'admin' permissions). Admin will also allow you to kick/add members to the group at any time. Edit will allow the member to manage expenses for the group, but not manage the members. View will only allow the member to see and receive notifications from the shared budget. Notifications for expenses will be sent out to everyone in the group for the group expenses just like with any other periodic expense. Registered users have the ability to log income and keep track of the period, amount, and type with the option to change details as needed. Each registered user will have access to their own settings allowing them to view and change various options related to their in app experience, like notification choices and a view of their lifetime savings. Periodic Expenses are linked to different attributes that can change how their data is viewed. This is done with an enumerated period of time of either daily, weekly, monthly, and never.

# Tests
Our app uses JUnit to run tests on our classes and methods.
https://github.com/ChrisCalah/BetrBudget/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/example/btrbudget/UserSettingsTest.java
In this example we tested if the length of the expense list increases when an expense is added in the class User Settings

# Code quality

Throughout the coding process for our app BetrBudget we all madesure veryone adhered to a set of coding guidelines so the code was very readable and easy to follow. We all aggreed upon how our code should be written and the variables be named to not cause any confusion. Our coding policies included:

-simple and clean variable naming

-consistent line spacing and indentation

-comments where necessary to facilitate a better group work environment

-create classes where applicable as to not clutter the main file

-resolved any merge conflics on repository before pushing

# Lessons Learned

In this implementation we learned to be more organized in our approach to splitting up the work. We dedicated more time to adding requirements and communicated more frequently to make the process as smooth as possible. Last time we ran close to the deadline so an earlier and more regular work schedule was a drastic improvement. We struggled with implementing the server side, but eventually were able to include some SQL. We have all gained much more knowledge into the inner workings of android studio.
